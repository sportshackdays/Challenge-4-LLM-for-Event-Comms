Based at the Service Course in Sursee and partner destination Andermatt, the third training camp of the season was a great opportunity to train together and lay the foundations for a successful second part of the season. Five riders of the U23 team joined their elders: <NAME_1>, <NAME_2>, <NAME_3>, <NAME_4> and <NAME_5>.  The Story Goes On <URL_2> <URL_3> <URL_4> Three riders have extended their contracts with Tudor Pro Cycling. We are excited to have <NAME_6>, <NAME_7> and <NAME_8> riding for the team until 2026. I am very happy to continue with Tudor Pro Cycling over the next few years Swiss rider <LAST_NAME_1> said. The team is growing fast and has high goals for the next seasons. It is very motivating for me but also very interesting to experience from the inside the evolution of a team from the continental level (with Swiss Racing Academy). The mutual trust that I have with the management of the team as well as the role that I am given in the team are very important to me and for the rest of my career. Team CEO <NAME_9> is proud of this new development: These three guys have already proven themselves in the first eight months with the team. The new contracts are more than deserved! We are proud, that they trust us enough to sign long term contracts until 2026.  What's Up Next? * Tour d'Alsace (FRA), 26-30.07, Devo Team * Sazka Tour (CZE), 27-30.07, Pro Team * Tour of Poland, 28.07-4.08, Pro Team And many more. Check the full race calendar now.

       "    'body': 'Hello Dear Friend Good day and compliments, I know this letter will definitely come to you as a surprise, but I implore you to take time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go a long way to determine my future and continued existence. I have a business proposal for you. I am a Major with the United Nations troop, I was retired after I served one tour in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan. I was not called back to duty when the Libya crisis went out of control, so now we have been transferred to Libya, in the war against terrorism. Based on the United States legislative and executive decision, for withdrawing troops from Libya. Our mission is to help beef up terrorist targeted states, mostly the United States and the European Union on war against terrorism. On the other hand I want to inform you that I have in my possession the sum of ($10.4million USD) Which I got from a crude oil deal here in Iraq and also my entitlement funds from the UN as a member of NATO. I deposited this money in WoodForest National Bank USA informing them that we are making contact for the real owner of the cash money. It is under my power to approve whoever comes forth for this cash money. I want to invest the money in your country as soon as I am deployed for a good business, anyway you will advise me on that since I am not a business person. I will be in your country for about 3 years for my investments over there, so I need someone I could trust. If you accept, I will transfer the money to you. And you will be the beneficiary because I am a uniformed person and I cannot be parading such an amount so I need to present someone as the beneficiary. I am an American and an intelligence officer so to say, I have a 100% authentic means of transferring the money to you with good arrangement from the Wood Forest Bank USA as I present to you. I just need your acceptance and trust, and then all is done. Please if you are interested in this transaction I will give you the complete details you need for us to carry out this transaction successfully, I decided to find someone that is real and not imaginary and that is why I went for a secured site where I can be sure that the person is real. I believe I can trust you. Where we are now we can only communicate through our military communication facilities which are much secured so nobody can monitor our conversation, then I can explain in detail to you at the moment I can only reach you through email, because our calls might be monitored, i just have to be sure of whom I am dealing with. I will give you 35% of the sum and 65% is for me. I hope I have been fair on this deal, get back to me with your full information. If you are interested please send me your personal details for further information when I am out of our military network and write from a fresh email account so if you are not interested do not reply to this e-mail and please delete this message, if no response after 7days I will then search for someone else. I wait for your contact details so we can go on. Regards, <NAME_1>'}],\n",
