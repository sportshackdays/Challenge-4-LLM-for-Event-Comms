I apologize for persisting, but I had put in a lot of effort and was genuinely looking forward to attempting my first marathon. I understand that the registration is closed, and on-site registrations on the day of the marathon are not accepted. However, I wanted to inquire if there might be any alternative options for me to participate. For instance, if someone doesn't pick up their bib, could I potentially take their place? Alternatively, if someone requests a refund in the coming days, could I be considered to fill that vacancy? I understand that you are likely very busy, and it is clearly stated on the website that exceptions will not be made. Still, I had placed a great deal of hope in this race. Thank you for your understanding. <SENDER_FIRST_NAME_1>"
